Look at time and hgroup element.

- [x] #Time Element-

  The time element does what it says on the tin. It presents the time. You can have it present the time in 24 hour are a more precise with the time and date.
  
  Firstly I tried my hand at just the basic time element. This is just <time> rapping around xx:xx.
  
  <p>The moive starts at <time>21:00</time>.</p>
  
  The Question is why use the time element. You will be happey to know I have found the answer. Its not for use, its for the computer/ machine. It helps the machine to find and read the time easier. This will be helpfull for people that want this information on there calender.
  
  <p>The match is taking place on <time datetime="2015-09-23 21:00">October 21</time>.</p>
  
  This is what the machine sees time datetime="2015-09-23 21:00" and is able to locate this easier.
  
  The best way to think of it is when batmans light is used to tell him he is needed. He knows were he has to go and finds it right away.
